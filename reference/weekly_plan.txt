WEEK 0 — PROJECT FRAMING & GUARDRAILS
Theme: Lock architecture before writing logic
Initialize repository
Create README with scope, in-scope, out-of-scope
Decide on immutability (frozen dataclasses)
Decide on minimal / optional ML usage
Set up pyproject.toml
Set up pytest
Verify pytest runs without errors

WEEK 1 — DOMAIN PRIMITIVES
Theme: Define the objects that exist in the system
Define OptionContract (symbol, expiry, strike, call/put, exercise style)
Define Position (option, quantity, entry price)
Define Portfolio (cash, tuple of positions)
Enforce immutability everywhere
Implement repr and eq via dataclasses
Add basic sanity tests for object creation

WEEK 2 — PORTFOLIO MATH & VALUATION
Theme: Compute values without mutating state
Define OptionPricer interface
Add position market value method (returns float)
Add position unrealized PnL method (returns float)
Add portfolio total market value method
Add portfolio total unrealized PnL method
Pass pricer explicitly (no hidden dependencies)
Write unit tests for valuation math

WEEK 3 — OPTION PRICING
Theme: Separate pricing from portfolio logic
Implement Black-Scholes pricer (European)
Compute Greeks as immutable value object
Validate pricing against known values
Add placeholder for American pricer
Write tests for pricing accuracy

WEEK 4 — PERSISTENCE & SNAPSHOTS
Theme: Make results reproducible
Define PortfolioSnapshot object
Persist snapshots to SQLite (append-only)
Store valuation inputs and outputs
Load snapshots for replay
Test snapshot round-trip consistency

WEEK 5 — STRATEGIES & TRADES
Theme: Express intent, not execution
Define Trade object (open / close)
Implement basic options strategies (e.g., Iron Condor)
Strategy outputs trades, not side effects
Apply trades to portfolio immutably
Test strategy invariants

WEEK 6 — BACKTESTING LOOP
Theme: Run the system over time
Build backtest runner
Iterate over market data
Apply strategies per timestep
Generate portfolio snapshots
Produce PnL time series

OPTIONAL WEEK — REGIME TAGGING
Theme: Lightweight AI signal without overreach
Define regime categories (volatility, trend)
Implement simple heuristic or classifier
Attach regime tag to snapshots
Use regime as conditional input to strategies
Keep regime logic read-only and optional
